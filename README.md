# VNA-based-Orthodontic-Stress-Testing-System
Using MATLAB with the VISA interface to control the VNA instrument for collecting S-parameter spectra, calculating spectral differences, identifying the positions of spectral valleys, and annotating them.

1. System requirements
The application is built on MATLAB 2023b and run on windows, and requires Keysight IO Libraries Suite to connect the VNA.

2. Installation guide
The application could be run on the PC with MATLAB insltalled by opening the "ENATest.mlapp" file, or could be installed with the released file "ENATestSteup.exe".
